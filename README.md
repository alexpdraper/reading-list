### Building

Or, if you would rather do it the hard way, you can build the extension from the source code:

1. Make sure you have Node and NPM installed
1. Download/clone this repo
1. Install all the dependencies:
   ```bash
   # From the project folder
   npm install
   ```
1. Run the build command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The build command assembles all the files in the `build` folder. After it’s built, you can load it into Chrome or Firefox.

#### Load into Chrome

1. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
1. Check “Developer Mode”
1. Click “Load unpacked extension…”
1. Load up the “dist” folder

## Using the extension

1. Go to a page you want to save for later
1. Click the reading list icon on the top right of your browser ![Chrome Reading List icon](extension/icons/icon32.png)
1. Click the `+` button
   - You can also right-click anywhere on the page and select “Add page to Reading List”
1. When you want to read a page you saved, open up the extension and click the reading item you want to read
   - `Control + click` or `command ⌘/windows key ⊞ + click` to open the page in a new tab
1. Done with a page? Click the `×` next to said page in your reading list, and it will magically vanish.
